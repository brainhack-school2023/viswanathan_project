Hello I am Subhasri Viswanathan and I am a Master's Student in the Department of Neuroscience at University of Montreal. I work with Dr. Patricia Conrod at CHU Sainte Justine where my work is focused on fMRI data of adoloscent brain development and addiction.

# Project Pitch - Resting State Functional network connectivity changes of adoloscents who are at risk for addiction. 
## Background
Adolescence is characterized by significant brain developmental changes and I am interested in understanding the functional network connectivity changes from a developmental perspective and explore the influence of substance use on these developing brain networks. 


## Main questions to answer
1. How does resting state functional connectivity change as a function of development
2. How does cannabis influence this strength in connectivity across time 


## Objectives
1. To use nilearn to compute functional network connectivity measures
2. Visualization tools - plotly
3. To use Github for version control and data management

## Tools 
I will be using the following tools and libraries for my project
1. Github
2. Nilearn
3. Nibabel
4. Plotly 

## Data
The data collected as a part of the Neuro Venture Trial where 132 adolescents were sub-sampled from the Co-Venture trial [Conrod, 2016](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01655615) for a structural and functional neuroimaging study at three-time points namely T1 ( baseline), T2 ( 24 months from baseline ) and T3( 48 months from baseline). The study followed exclusion criteria of any major neuro-developmental disorders (e.g., autism), uncorrectable visual impairment or hearing deficits, severe mental health problems (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), uninterruptible central nervous system medication, and any magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications like pregnancy or braces [Bourque et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153672/). All the participants underwent structural and functional neuroimaging with two cognitive tasks namely the Stop Signal task and the Monetary Incentive Delay Task at all three-time points. Timeline follow-back interviews were conducted face-to-face at each time point to assess alcohol and drug use patterns over the last 6 months.

## Deliverables
At the end of the school, the following will be my deliverables
1. A Jupyter notebook  
2. Documentation as Git Repo markdown
